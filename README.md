# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview
Fake news has become a serious issue in the digital age, spreading misinformation quickly across online platforms. This project implements a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify news articles as REAL or FAKE based on their textual content.
The model uses TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction and a Passive Aggressive Classifier for efficient and accurate classification.

## Features
- Text preprocessing using TF-IDF
- Machine learning–based classification
- Uses Passive Aggressive Classifier (fast and scalable)
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix

## Model Used
### Passive Aggressive Classifier
- An online learning algorithm
- Efficient for large-scale text classification
- Updates only when predictions are incorrect
